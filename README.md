Introduction
The Caesar cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter located a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The program uses this algorithm to perform encryption and decryption based on user input.

How the Program Works
The program uses a simple Caesar cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the text. Users can input any text and specify a shift value (integer) to apply to each character. The shift value determines how many positions each letter in the input text should be shifted to create the encrypted text.

Getting Started
Install Python: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Clone the Repository: Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Install Dependencies: The program requires the following Python packages, which you can install using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tkinter pillow ttkthemes
Run the Program: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:
bash
Copy code
python simple_encoder_decoder_gui.py
Usage
Upon running the program, a GUI window will open with an input field to enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted.

Enter the desired text in the input field.

Next, enter a shift value (integer) to specify the number of positions each letter should be shifted during encryption or decryption.

Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the input text, or click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the text using the specified shift value.

The result of the operation (encrypted or decrypted text) will be displayed in the output label.

To perform another encryption or decryption, repeat the process with new input and shift value.

Customization
The GUI appearance can be customized by modifying the code in the simple_encoder_decoder_gui.py file. You can change the font, colors, layout, and add additional widgets to suit your preferences.

Known Issues
The program is designed for educational purposes and may not be suitable for secure encryption needs. It uses a simple Caesar cipher, which can be easily cracked with modern cryptographic methods.
